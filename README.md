# CodeCore Project (StackOverflow Clone)

## Overview

CodeCore is a project inspired by StackOverflow, focusing on implementing core functionalities and establishing a robust connection between the backend and frontend.

## Responsiveness

The primary emphasis of this project is on functionality rather than design. As a result, the current version may not be fully optimized for responsiveness. The primary goal was to build a working prototype with a focus on the technical aspects.

## Future Improvements

While the project may not be responsive in its current state, future updates could include enhancements to improve the user experience across various devices and screen sizes. Contributions and suggestions for improving the project's responsiveness are highly welcome.
